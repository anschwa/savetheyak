> You see, yak shaving is what you are doing when you're doing some stupid, fiddly little task that bears no obvious relationship to what you're supposed to be working on, but yet a chain of twelve causal relations links what you're doing to the original meta-task.

[Kill The Yak][KillTheYak] is a website with guides that will reduce the time you spend yak shaving.

## Hacking

Kill The Yak is a small Flask app that uses Flask-FlatPages and Flask-Frozen to build the static content. The app itself lives in the [killtheyak/ directory](https://github.com/killtheyak/killtheyak.github.com/tree/master/killtheyak). Feel free to use, modify, or just browse around.
